    <p>The Art Deco-style Christ the Redeemer statue has been looming over
        the Brazilians from upon Corcovado mountain in an awe-inspiring state of
        eternal blessing since 1931. The 130-foot reinforced concrete-and-soapstone statue was
        designed by Heitor da Silva Costa and cost approximately $250,000 to build - much of
        the money was raised through donations.
        The statue has become an easily recognized icon for Rio and Brazil.</p>
