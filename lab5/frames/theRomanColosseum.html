    <h5>The Roman Colosseum (Rome)</h5>
    <img src="https://travel.home.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/travel/fullset/2015/10/12/new-seven-wonders-roman-coloesseum.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1491581548881.jpeg">
    <p>Rome's, if not Italy's, most enduring icon is undoubtedly its Colosseum. Built between A.D. 70 and 80
        A.D., it was in use for some 500 years. The elliptical structure sat nearly 50,000 spectators,
        who gathered to watch the gladiatorial events as well as other public spectacles, including battle
        reenactments, animal hunts and executions. Earthquakes and stone-robbers have left the Colosseum
        in a state of ruin, but portions of the structure remain open to tourists,
        and its design still influences the construction of modern-day amphitheaters, some 2,000 years later.</p>
