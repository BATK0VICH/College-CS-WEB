    <p>Built between the 5th century B.C. and the 16th century, the Great Wall of
        China is a stone-and-earth fortification created to protect the borders
        of the Chinese Empire from invading Mongols. The Great Wall is actually a succession
        of multiple walls spanning approximately 4,000 miles, making it the world's longest
        manmade structure.</p>
