                      <h5>Great Wall of China</h5>
                      <p>Built between the 5th century B.C. and the 16th century, the Great Wall of 
                          China is a stone-and-earth fortification created to protect the borders
                           of the Chinese Empire from invading Mongols. The Great Wall is actually a succession 
                           of multiple walls spanning approximately 4,000 miles, making it the world's longest
                            manmade structure.</p>

                      <p>The Art Deco-style Christ the Redeemer statue has been looming over 
                        the Brazilians from upon Corcovado mountain in an awe-inspiring state of 
                        eternal blessing since 1931. The 130-foot reinforced concrete-and-soapstone statue was 
                        designed by Heitor da Silva Costa and cost approximately $250,000 to build - much of 
                        the money was raised through donations. 
                        The statue has become an easily recognized icon for Rio and Brazil.</p>

                      <h5>Machu Picchu (Peru)</h5>
                      <p>Machu Picchu, an Incan city of sparkling granite precariously perched between 2 towering Andean peaks, 
                        is thought by scholars to have been a sacred archaeological center for the nearby Incan capital of Cusco. 
                        Built at the peak of the Incan Empire in the mid-1400s, this mountain citadel was later abandoned by the 
                        Incas. The site remained unknown except to locals until 1911, when it was rediscovered by archaeologist 
                        Hiram Bingham. 
                        The site can only be reached by foot, train or helicopter; most visitors visit by train from nearby Cusco.</p>

                      <p>The genius and adaptability of Mayan culture can be seen in the splendid ruins of Chichen Itza. 
                        This powerful city, a trading center for cloth, slaves, honey and salt, flourished from approximately 800 
                        to 1200, and acted as the political and economic hub of the Mayan civilization. 
                        The most familiar ruin at the site is El Caracol, a sophisticated astronomical observatory.</p>

                      <p>Rome's, if not Italy's, most enduring icon is undoubtedly its Colosseum. Built between A.D. 70 and 80 
                        A.D., it was in use for some 500 years. The elliptical structure sat nearly 50,000 spectators, 
                        who gathered to watch the gladiatorial events as well as other public spectacles, including battle 
                        reenactments, animal hunts and executions. Earthquakes and stone-robbers have left the Colosseum 
                        in a state of ruin, but portions of the structure remain open to tourists,
                         and its design still influences the construction of modern-day amphitheaters, some 2,000 years later.</p>

                      <p>A mausoleum commissioned for the wife of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, the Taj Mahal was built between 
                        1632 and 1648. Considered the most perfect specimen of Muslim art in India, the white marble structure 
                        actually represents a number of architectural styles, including Persian, Islamic, Turkish and Indian. 
                        The Taj 
                        Mahal also encompasses formal gardens of raised pathways, sunken flower beds and a linear reflecting pool.</p>

                      <p>
                        Declared a World Heritage Site in 1985, Petra was the capital of the Nabataean empire of
                         King Aretas IV, and likely existed in its prime from 9 B.C. to A.D. 40. The members of this 
                         civilization proved to be early experts in manipulating water technology, constructing intricate 
                         tunnels and water chambers, which helped create an pseudo-oasis. A number of incredible structures carved 
                        into stone, a 4,000-seat amphitheater and the El-Deir monastery have also helped the site earn its fame.</p>
